# BEP_1925
Repository of Fixation Data and all Matlab Code used in Bachelor End Project (BEP, experiment 1925) by Daniël Ris

All Matlab code can be found in the Matlab_Code directory. Run the code using the .main file, which connects to all relevant functions in the rest of the .m files.
The 2IMC algorithm was constructed by Hessels et al. (2016), and rewritten by Hooge et al. (2022).
The data used in the 1925 experiment, collected by Daniël Ris and Renske van Dijk, can be retrieved from the experiment leaders. Please contact d.e.m.ris@student.tue.nl for this.
